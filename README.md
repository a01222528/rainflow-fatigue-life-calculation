# rainflow-fatigue-life-calculation
This repository contains the code used in the final document "Time Series Rainflow Analysis For Fatigue Life Calculation" for Applied Mathematics course at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.

This code includes the next algorithms:

1. Rainflow Counting
    - Hysteresis Filtering
    - Peak-Valley Filtering
    - Discretization (Binning)
    - Four Point Counting Method
    
2. Fatigue Theory - Stress Life
